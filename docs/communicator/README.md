# FIN Communicator
This is the core concept behind how [RootAPI](/rootapi/) accomplishes it's seemingly impossible goals. 

To begin we have to discuss how we handle 'Root' calls and what that actually means.


## What is a Root API call
A Root API call is any call that is not provided by Ficsit Networks.
!> Root API calls **REQUIRE** the user to also be running a C# program, either derived from fincommunicator.dll, or an official un-offical host program written by me.


## What are the limits
There are none. Just kidding, but this is a virtually limitless power with the only limiter being the host programs written for it. Some working examples atm include: Pastebin Get, Clipboard Get/Set, SystemTime Info, and more to come.
