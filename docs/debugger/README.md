# Fin Debugger
The Debugger is a simple program that will extend the FINCommunicator.dll and send a notification to any computer that's listening, or a specific one, saving and running your program. All from the click of a mouse, or F5 if you use VSCODE, and making development of your scripts all the smoother!

## How to use it?
Simply edit your preferred editors launch config and set the program to FINDebugger.exe and pass in the desired files path and an optional computer ID to have run the program as arguments.
